# Genetic-characteristics-of-the-Han100K-initiative
We estimated pairwise FST for any two provincial populations and inferred ancestry composition for each of the provincial populations.<br><br>

### Pairwise FST
Genetic differentiation between populations was measured with pairwise FST.

### Ancestry Composition
The ancestry composition of each population was inferred with the ADMIXTURE (V1.3.0).
