# Genetic-characteristics-of-the-Han100K-initiative
We calculated pairwise FST and Ancestry components for each provincial population.

<br>The Excel file contains two sheets. Record the distance matrix and genetic components separately.<br>For specific details, please refer to the article.<br><br>

### Pairwise FST
Genetic distances between populations were calculated using pairwise FST.

### Ancestry Components
We used the ADMIXTURE (V1.3.0) program to estimate the ancestry components.
